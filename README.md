# Task Manager - Ruby + PostgreSQL

This project is a simple task manager built entirely in **Ruby**, using **PostgreSQL** for data storage.

> âœ… **Important:** This is my **first project using Ruby** and also my **first contact with PostgreSQL**.  
I'm building it to practice backend development, database management, and real project structuring.

## ðŸ’¡ About the Project

This is a terminal-based task manager where you can:

- Add tasks
- List tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Remove tasks

All tasks are stored in a PostgreSQL database, not in memory.

The main goal of this project is to help me understand:

- Ruby syntax and logic
- How to connect Ruby to a PostgreSQL database
- How to structure and organize a backend project

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Ruby (pure Ruby, no frameworks)
- PostgreSQL
- DBeaver (for database management)
- Git + GitHub (for version control)
